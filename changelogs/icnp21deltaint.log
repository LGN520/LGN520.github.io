Version 1.2.0
    - Open-source P4 hardware implementation deployed in Tofino switch

Version 1.1.0
    - Introduce two variants for DeltaINT: (i) DeltaINT-O (the one proposed in
      the ICNP'21 paper) and (ii) DeltaINT-E (which uses delta encoding to
      embed the delta that is within a threshold into a packet).
    - Add DeltaINT-E in gray failure detection, congestion control, and
      latency measurement
    - Add fine-grained monitoring for both DeltaINT-O and DeltaINT-E

Version 1.0.0
    - First version of the code.
