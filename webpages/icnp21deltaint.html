<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
In-band network telemetry (INT) enriches network
management at scale through the embedding of complete deviceinternal
states into each packet along its forwarding path, yet
such embedding of INT information also incurs significant bandwidth
overhead in the data plane.We propose DeltaINT, a general
INT framework that achieves extremely low bandwidth overhead
and supports various packet-level and flow-level applications in
network management. DeltaINT builds on the insight that state
changes are often negligible at most time, so it embeds a state into
a packet only when the state change is deemed significant. We
theoretically derive the time/space complexities and the bounds
of bandwidth mitigation for DeltaINT. We implement DeltaINT
in both software and P4. Our evaluation shows that DeltaINT
reduces up to 93% of INT bandwidth, and its deployment in a
Barefoot Tofino switch incurs limited hardware resource usage.
