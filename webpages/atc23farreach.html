	FarReach: Write-back Caching in Programmable Switches
</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
Skewed write-intensive key-value storage workloads are increasingly
observed in modern data centers, yet they also
incur server overloads due to load imbalance. Programmable
switches provide viable solutions for realizing load-balanced
caching on the I/O path, and hence implementing write-back
caching in programmable switches is a natural direction to
absorb frequent writes for high write performance. However,
enabling in-switch write-back caching is non-trivial, as it
not only is challenged by the strict programming rules and
limited stateful memory of programmable switches, but also
necessitates reliable protection against data loss due to switch
failures. We propose FarReach, a new caching framework
that supports fast, available, and reliable in-switch write-back
caching. FarReach carefully co-designs both the control and
data planes for cache management in programmable switches,
so as to achieve high data-plane performance with lightweight
control-plane management. Experiments on a Tofino switch
testbed show that FarReach achieves a throughput gain of up
to 6.6X over a state-of-the-art in-switch caching approach
under skewed write-intensive workloads.
